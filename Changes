0.4 2011-09-06
  * fm_diff_config

      * win
      * prt
      * asm
      * frm
      * tbl
      are treated as binary files and all files where -B returns true.
  * Fixed not working duplicate checking, therefore changed structure in Load.pm functions. This causes many changes in all files.
  * fm_check_struct
    * Added option -e or --environment. If set, fm_check_struct creates an proe working directory with the selected structure.
      It also creates a shortcut on the desktop, so that proe can be started easily with the structure to test.
