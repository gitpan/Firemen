=head1 NAME

CAD::Firemen::Change::Type - Constants to represant the change type of Firemen::Change

=head1 VERSION

version 0.5.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NoChange  - There is no change between two values.
NoSpecial - It's a normal change and not a change of the ones listed below.

Special changes:

Case                    - The values are the same, but changed in case (e.g: yes to YES)
Path                    - The values may be different, but they are paths and therefore they may change from release to release
ValuesChanged           - At least one possible value has changed (Removed or added)
DefaultValueChanged     - The default value is changed

Note that the values are strings, therefore they must be compared with "ne" and "eq" like

if($change->changeType() eq Firemen::Change::Type->NoChange){}
